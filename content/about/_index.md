various infrastructures, from Kubernetes to classic Packer AMI on ASG behind an
ALB.

### Path

I come from a far away land, where people live down under. I traveled a lot to
finaly come in France to study network and system engineering. I worked around
in diffrent fields (security, networking, legacy admin sys) until i discover
the Cloud world, which I found the onl way to do things properly.
